            | After my commercial apprenticeship, I have since continued my education in computer science and completed
            | my Bachelor's degree in business informatics in 2019. Since then I have been employed as a software
            | developer and I am constantly improving my skills. This portfolio page should show what I have learnt so
            | far. Do you have any questions? Then please contact me!
